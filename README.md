# Musical Preferences Analysis in Springfield and Shelbyville

## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing user musical preferences in two cities: Springfield and Shelbyville, using online music streaming data. The objective is to compare user activities and musical preferences in these cities to test three key hypotheses:

1. User activity varies depending on the day of the week and the city.
2. Musical tastes differ between Monday mornings and Friday nights in both cities.
3. Musical genre preferences differ between Springfield (more pop) and Shelbyville (more rap).

The analysis is conducted in three main stages: data description, data preprocessing, and hypothesis testing.
